### August 7th, 2020 - Thursday

**project:** Question: what is Node.JS?

**note:**

- Node.js is a javascript runtime built on JavaScript V8 Engine, written in C++
- JS can only access browser, with NodeJs, it can access local machine and can be used for building utilities, web server, file control, etc
- `npm init` can package the dependencies and create a package.json file for providing dependency info, `npm install` will use this json file to install the required package
- V8 is a high-performance interpreter, help transferring JS code to machine code. It is running in browser but Node.js wraps it and make it run in local machine
